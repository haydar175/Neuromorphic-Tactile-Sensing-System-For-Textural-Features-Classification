# Neuromorphic-Tactile-Sensing-System-For-Textural-Features-Classification
This repository lists out the implemented scripts for the work done in the manuscript entitled "Neuromorphic Tactile Sensing System For Textural Features Classification".
We first discuss the encoding procedure which we converted the raw tactile signals of the artificial gratings. Following this, we tune tune the refractory period of the encoding models based on Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neuron using the Brian2 Simulator
