This repository contains the implemented scripts corresponding to the research presented in the manuscript titled "Neuromorphic Tactile Sensing System For Textural Features Classification." You can access the manuscript on the IEEE Sensors Journal via the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2024.3382369.

First, we discuss the encoding procedure where we convert the raw tactile signals from artificial gratings into spikes by modeling SA-I and RA-I mechanoreceptors. Then, we adjust the refractory period of the encoding models using the Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neuron implemented in the Brian2 Simulator.

In the second part of this tutorial, we explain the implementation procedure of the recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN).
